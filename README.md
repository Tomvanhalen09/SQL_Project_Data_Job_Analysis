# 1. Introduction
In this project, I dive into global and Dutch job postings data to uncover **top skills in demand** and **high-paying opportunities**, providing valuable insights for job seekers and career builders. 

Using SQL, I analyzed which skills are most sought-after and which bring in the highest salaries, especially in the Netherlands, where I'm currently job hunting. The SQL-querys I built can be found in the [project_sql](/project_sql/) folder.

Whether you're looking to upskill, pivot into a new field, or simply stay competitive, this project sheds light on skills that are both highly valued and highly rewarded in todayâ€™s job market.
# 2. Background
To build my SQL skills, I completed a course led by Luke Barousse, where I followed along with his YouTube tutorial on writing SQL queries. This hands-on approach allowed me to understand core concepts while practicing directly in SQL. 

Inspired by his methods, I adapted the queries to explore insights aligned with my own career interestsâ€”specifically, analyzing in-demand skills and high-paying job roles globally and in the Netherlands. 

For anyone interested, hereâ€™s the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA) by Luke Barousse and a link to his [website](https://www.lukebarousse.com) where you can find the dataset that fueled my analysis.

### The questions I plan to answer in this project are:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
# 3. Tools I Used
The tools I used to analyse the different job postings are:
- YouTube: The main support for this project was the SQL Course offered by Luke Barousse
- PostgreSQL: The database management system I used to setup my database and load in the different flat data files
- SQL: The main tool of my analysis, allowing me to write queries to retrieve relevant data important insights out of my database
- Visual Studio Code: The code editor I use to setup databases and write my queries.
- ChatGPT: The AI chatbot I used to visualise and further analyse the findings I retrieved from my queries.
- Git & GitHub: I used Git and GitHub to help me with version control and to share my SQL scripts and analysis with the world.






# 4. The Analysis







# 5. What I Learned
Throughout this project, I was able to put my theoretical knowledge from various courses into practice.
- **Database setup** ðŸ’¾: I set up a PostgreSQL database and   linked it to VS Code, providing a seamless environment for querying and analysis.
- **Query writing** ðŸ§©: I practiced writing SQL queries, gaining comfort with the basics and more advanced techniques, such as:
    - Aggregate functions like COUNT() and AVG() used in combination with GROUP BY
    - Common Table Expressions (CTE's)
    - Joins
- **Git/GitHub and Repositories** ðŸ”—: I became comfortable with basic Git commands, like push and pull, and successfully created and linked a repository from VS Code to GitHub for version control and sharing.
